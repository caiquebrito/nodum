New `find_similar_code` MCP tool and companion `nodum similar-code <projectPath> <nodeId> [--json]` CLI command: finds other functions/methods structurally near-identical to a given node. A thin, node-scoped lookup on top of spec 015's `detectDuplicates` (reused directly, not re-implemented) — "what's similar to this" rather than a global duplication report. `findSimilarCode()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse.
