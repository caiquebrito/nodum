New `trace_impact` MCP tool and companion `nodum trace-impact <projectPath> <nodeId> [--max-depth N] [--json]` CLI command: shows every file transitively affected by changing a given file/function/class — the cascade of changes if you modify X. Walks incoming `imports` edges via BFS, cycle-safe, resolving function/method/class nodes to their owning file first (the graph has no call/reference edges, so per-function impact within an affected file isn't determined — only which files transitively depend on it). `traceImpact()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse. Distinct from the existing `get_dependents` tool, which is one-hop only.
