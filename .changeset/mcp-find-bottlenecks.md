New `find_bottlenecks` MCP tool and companion `nodum bottlenecks [projectPath] [--json] [--limit N]` CLI command: ranks files by a composite bottleneck score combining code complexity (spec 014) with how many other files transitively depend on them (spec 016's `traceImpact`). A highly complex file nobody depends on ranks lower than a moderately complex one many files import — `score = maxComplexity × (1 + dependentCount)`. Both raw components are returned alongside the score for auditability. `findBottlenecks()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse; composes existing analyzers rather than adding new graph-traversal logic.
