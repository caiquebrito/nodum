# nodum — Local Code Memory for Claude

> A self-hosted knowledge graph that gives Claude persistent memory about your projects — with an interactive 3D visualizer.

## The Problem

Every time you open a new Claude Code session, it starts from scratch. You explain your stack again. Re-describe the architecture. Paste the same file paths over and over. Claude is smart, but it has no memory — and this constant re-explanation wastes time and breaks your train of thought.

The common solution is to dump everything into `CLAUDE.md`. But that becomes a mess quickly: no structure, no automation, outdated as soon as the code changes, and you still write it all manually.

---

## The Idea

What if Claude always knew about your project — the files, functions, dependencies, the decisions you made last week — without you needing to explain it again?

That's what nodum does. A **local knowledge graph** that lives alongside your projects:

- Scans your code and builds a structured map of files, functions, classes, and imports
- Automatically detects your stack (Android, Kotlin, Python, Go, Rust, Docker…) and generates a project summary
- Maintains session logs — what Claude worked on each day, what was decided, what's next
- Injects context into `CLAUDE.md` so Claude reads the graph before answering **anything**
- Serves an **interactive 3D visualizer** — orbit, zoom, click nodes, see connections live

Everything runs locally. No API calls, no cloud, no subscription.

---

## How It Works

The goal was to keep it simple — no frameworks, no build step, no package managers. Just Python and vanilla JS.

The sync script (`scripts/sync.py`) reads your project files using Python's `ast` module for Kotlin/Java and regex patterns for other languages. It traverses the directory tree, extracts nodes (files, functions, classes) and edges (imports, definitions), and writes a `graph.json`. It also reads config files — `build.gradle`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, `settings.gradle`, `.env.example` — and generates a `SUMMARY.md` with stack, build variants, and environment variables already filled in.

The visualizer (`viewer/app.js`) uses [3d-force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph) — a 3D force-directed graph in WebGL — to render your code as a living atom you can orbit and explore. Nodes are sized by connection count. Import edges have animated particles flowing through them. Click a node and a detail panel slides in showing everything it imports and everything that uses it.

The injection into `CLAUDE.md` forces Claude to print a formatted context block at the start of each session — stack, file count, last sync date, project summary — before answering anything.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caiquebrito/nodum ~/path/to/nodum
cd ~/path/to/nodum
```

No dependencies to install — just Python 3.9+ (standard library only).

### 2. Sync a project

```bash
python3 scripts/sync.py /path/to/your/android/project
```

This will:
- Parse all `.kt`, `.java`, `.gradle`, `.py`, `.js`, `.ts` files and generate the graph
- Auto-detect the stack from `build.gradle`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.
- Create `<project>/memory/SUMMARY.md` pre-filled with stack, build variants, and dependencies
- Write a `CLAUDE.md` in your project forcing Claude to load context each session
- Create a daily log in `<project>/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### 3. Start the visualizer

```bash
python3 serve.py
```

Opens `http://localhost:7842/` automatically. The 3D graph is interactive:
- **Drag** to orbit, **scroll** to zoom
- **Click** a node to see its connections in the detail panel
- **Hover** for tooltip with name, type, and file path
- **Sidebar** shows the real folder tree with functions nested under files
- **Sync button** rescans the current project's code (no terminal needed)
- **Memory button** shows the SUMMARY.md of the project
- **Logs button** navigates through daily session logs

### 4. Check project status

```bash
python3 scripts/sync.py --status
```

## Integration with Claude Code

After syncing, your project's `CLAUDE.md` will contain:

```markdown
## Knowledge Graph Context — Required

ABSOLUTE RULE: at the start of each session, BEFORE answering anything, you MUST:

1. Read the files listed below in order
2. Print a context block:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Knowledge Graph loaded: myapp
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Stack:      Android · Kotlin · Jetpack Compose
  Files:      127 files · 84 classes · 312 functions
  Last sync:  2024-01-15 14:32
  Memory:     Mobile app for tracking user workouts...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Claude reads the graph, memory, and logs **before each response** — and always knows the project without re-explaining.

### Skills for Claude Code

The `/rag-sync` skill is available for use during Claude Code sessions. More details and improvements coming soon.

#### Installing Skills

Nodum includes ready-to-use Claude Code skills in the `claude-skills/` folder. To use them in your project:

1. Copy the skills from nodum into your project's `.claude` folder:
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/nodum/claude-skills/* /path/to/your/project/.claude/
   ```

2. Skills are now available as slash commands (e.g., `/rag-sync`) during your Claude Code sessions.

If `.claude` folder doesn't exist in your project, Claude Code will create it automatically on first use.

| File | What gets detected |
|------|-------------------|
| `build.gradle` | Language (Kotlin/Java), Android version, libraries, build flavors |
| `AndroidManifest.xml` | App name, permissions, Activities, Services |

- **Auto-fit on load** — graph always fits when switching projects
- **Size by degree** — more connected nodes appear larger
- **Animated particles on import edges** — points flow along dependency arrows
- **Sidebar with file tree** — same folder structure, functions nested under files
- **Project selector** — dropdown supporting unlimited projects
- **Sync button** — rescans code without leaving the interface (runs sync.py automatically)
- **Memory panel** — click Memory to read the SUMMARY.md
- **Session logs** — click Logs to browse daily session logs
- **Search** — find any function, file, or class in the graph
- **Detail panel** — click a node to see what it imports and what uses it
- **Export PNG** — download a screenshot of the current view
- **Auto-rotation** — smooth orbit when idle, pauses on interaction

```
node_modules  .git  dist  build  .next  __pycache__  coverage
.gradle  build/  .idea/  .DS_Store
