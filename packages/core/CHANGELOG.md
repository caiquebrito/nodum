# @caiquebrito/nodum-core

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 95fd195: New `appendMetricsLog()` in `nodum-core`, and a single instrumentation point in `nodum-mcp`'s tool dispatch (`packages/mcp/src/index.ts`) logging one JSONL line per MCP tool call to `~/.nodum/<project>/logs/metrics.jsonl` — tool name, project, duration, `approxTokens` (from spec 024), and success/failure. Makes token efficiency observable in real Claude Code sessions, not just the benchmark suite's fixture project (spec 025, part of the v2.2.0 measurement release).

  `handlers.ts`'s `NODUM_DATA_DIR` constant is now exported rather than private, so the dispatch layer can resolve the same `~/.nodum` root without a second definition.

- 902037f: New `countTokens(text): number` exported from `nodum-core` — an approximate, offline token count (via `js-tiktoken`'s `o200k_base` encoding) for text, since Claude's real tokenizer isn't public. Named `approxTokens` everywhere it surfaces, deliberately not `tokens`, to avoid repeating the precision the codebase previously asserted without measuring (spec 024 kicks off the v2.2.0 measurement release).

  `buildSmartContext()` in `nodum-mcp` now returns `{ text, approxTokens }` instead of a bare string — pure instrumentation, MCP response bodies are unchanged. A later spec in this series (026) uses `approxTokens` to replace the hardcoded "40-60% fewer tokens" claims with real numbers.

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 30af362: `nodum sync`/`nodum init` and the MCP server now check npm once a day for a newer published version and print a one-line update notice to stderr if you're behind — set `NODUM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` (or `CI=true`) to disable. Also fixes both the CLI's `--version` and the MCP server's reported version, which were hardcoded to a stale `1.0.0` placeholder instead of their real published versions.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d869063: `nodum architecture [projectPath] [--json] [--rule <from>:<to>]` — detect `imports` edges that violate declared layer rules (e.g. `ui:repo` disallows the `ui` group importing the `repo` group), using each node's existing group classification. Deny-list only, opt-in, with `*` wildcard support. Persist rules via `nodum config --set-architecture-rules <from>:<to>,...`, stored in `.nodumrc.json` under a new `architecture.rules` key. `detectArchitectureViolations()`/`loadArchitectureConfig()`/`saveArchitectureConfig()` are exported from `nodum-core` for reuse.

  Also fixes a latent bug in `saveScanConfig`: it previously round-tripped through only its own typed fields, silently deleting any other top-level key in `.nodumrc.json` (like the new `architecture` key) on the next `--set-include`/`--set-exclude`. It now merges into the raw JSON instead.

- b0ce5cf: Real `.gitignore` support (the `ignore` package was a dependency this whole time but never wired up) and `.nodumrc.json` include/exclude patterns via a new `nodum config` command. Also fixes `.go`/`.rs`/`.rb` extensions being discovered and counted in sync stats despite having no parser — the supported-extension list is now derived from the registered parsers themselves instead of a separately-maintained hardcoded list, so this can't drift again. Excluded directories now stop the file walk from recursing into them entirely, not just filter their contents afterward.
- ddbafe2: `nodum diff <a> <b> [--json]` — compare two graph snapshots (file paths, e.g. from `nodum export --format json`, or synced project names) and report added/removed/changed nodes, added/removed edges, and stat deltas. `diffGraphs()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse. Deliberately excludes `clusterId` (positional, renumbered every sync) and `embedding` (MCP-only enrichment) from change detection to avoid noisy false positives.
- 8273296: `nodum duplicates [projectPath] [--json]` — finds functions/methods that are structurally near-identical (same control-flow shape, robust to variable renaming and literal-value changes), computed at parse time as a new optional `Node.duplicateHash` field. TypeScript is normalized precisely via its real AST; JavaScript/Kotlin/Java use a new shared regex-based tokenizer built on spec 014's brace-body extraction. A 20-token minimum avoids flooding output with trivial one-liner "duplicates." `detectDuplicates()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse. Scoped to Type-2-style exact-structural matching within a single language — Type-3 (near-matches with inserted/deleted statements) and cross-language matching are both out of scope.
- 050e677: `nodum complexity [projectPath] [--json] [--threshold N]` — ranks functions/methods by cyclomatic complexity (McCabe), computed at parse time and stored as a new optional `Node.complexity` field. TypeScript is computed precisely from its real AST; JavaScript/Kotlin/Java use a new shared brace-matching body-extraction helper plus regex-based decision-point counting (deliberately excluding ternary for these three languages — a false-positive risk in Kotlin's nullable-type syntax). Python and cognitive complexity are both out of scope for now. `rankByComplexity()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse.

  Also fixes a real pre-existing bug in the Java parser's method-detection regex, caught while verifying this spec against real code: `} else if (...)` was mis-parsed as a method declaration named `if`.

- c6bcd9f: `nodum dead-code [projectPath] [--json] [--entry <patterns>]` — find files no other tracked file imports, as candidates for dead-code review (not a definitive verdict — a real entry point wired up outside the parsed import graph looks identical to an orphan). Excludes test-group files and files matching a built-in entry-point-name heuristic (`index.*`, `main.*`, `*.config.*`, etc.), extensible via `--entry` for framework-specific routing conventions. `detectUnreachableFiles()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse. Scoped to file-level reachability only — the graph has no call/reference edges yet, so symbol-level (unused function/class) detection isn't feasible today.
- c288b9c: `nodum cycles [projectPath] [--json]` — detect circular imports in a synced project. Uses Tarjan's SCC algorithm over `imports`-relation edges to find strongly-connected components of file nodes, reporting one representative cycle chain per component (not every elementary cycle, which is combinatorially expensive on tangled real codebases). `detectCycles()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse.
- 1a8580d: Import statements now resolve into real `imports` edges connecting file nodes, for TypeScript, JavaScript, Kotlin, and Java. Previously every parser extracted import specifiers and discarded them — the graph had zero cross-file edges. Relative TS/JS imports resolve via Node-style extension + `index.*` probing; Kotlin/Java imports (including wildcards) resolve via dotted-FQN suffix-matching against known file paths, shared across both languages for mixed-language projects. Incremental sync correctly preserves an `A→B` import edge when only `B` changes, and drops it when `B` is deleted or `A`'s import statement is removed.
- 4fe1527: `nodum sync --incremental` now actually skips re-reading and re-parsing files that haven't changed since the last sync, using the `graph/files.json` manifest — `discoverChangedFiles()` stat-checks every file first and only reads/hashes ones that look different, and `generateGraph()` evicts and re-parses only the changed set instead of doing a full rescan. Falls back silently to a full sync if there's no previous sync to diff against. Non-incremental `nodum sync` is unchanged.
- 7d502bf: New `explain_architecture` MCP tool and companion `nodum explain-architecture [projectPath] [--json]` CLI command: auto-generates an architecture overview — which layers (groups) exist, aggregate `imports` counts between every layer pair (including self-pairs), and any violations of the project's declared architecture rules (spec 013's `detectArchitectureViolations`, reused directly). The MCP tool automatically loads a project's `.nodumrc.json` rules via the existing `projects.json` index. `explainArchitecture()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse.
- 98a0fe6: New `find_bottlenecks` MCP tool and companion `nodum bottlenecks [projectPath] [--json] [--limit N]` CLI command: ranks files by a composite bottleneck score combining code complexity (spec 014) with how many other files transitively depend on them (spec 016's `traceImpact`). A highly complex file nobody depends on ranks lower than a moderately complex one many files import — `score = maxComplexity × (1 + dependentCount)`. Both raw components are returned alongside the score for auditability. `findBottlenecks()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse; composes existing analyzers rather than adding new graph-traversal logic.
- bb1838d: New `find_similar_code` MCP tool and companion `nodum similar-code <projectPath> <nodeId> [--json]` CLI command: finds other functions/methods structurally near-identical to a given node. A thin, node-scoped lookup on top of spec 015's `detectDuplicates` (reused directly, not re-implemented) — "what's similar to this" rather than a global duplication report. `findSimilarCode()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse.
- 595cfe1: New `suggest_refactoring` MCP tool and companion `nodum suggest-refactoring [projectPath] [--json] [--complexity-threshold N]` CLI command: a capstone synthesis of every analysis capability shipped in this series — circular imports (011), dead files (012), architecture-rule violations (013), overly complex functions (014, default threshold 10), and duplicated code (015) — into one unified suggestion feed, grouped in a fixed category order. Zero new detection logic; pure composition of existing analyzers, reused directly. `suggestRefactoring()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse.

  This closes out the v2.1.0 "Advanced Graph Analysis" and "MCP Enhancements" roadmap sections (specs 010–020).

- fe1b080: New `trace_impact` MCP tool and companion `nodum trace-impact <projectPath> <nodeId> [--max-depth N] [--json]` CLI command: shows every file transitively affected by changing a given file/function/class — the cascade of changes if you modify X. Walks incoming `imports` edges via BFS, cycle-safe, resolving function/method/class nodes to their owning file first (the graph has no call/reference edges, so per-function impact within an affected file isn't determined — only which files transitively depend on it). `traceImpact()` is exported from `nodum-core` for reuse. Distinct from the existing `get_dependents` tool, which is one-hop only.

### Patch Changes

- 878f510: `nodum watch [projectPath]` — watches a project and automatically runs an incremental sync on file changes (debounced, default 500ms, configurable via `--debounce`). Reuses the same `.gitignore`/`.nodumrc.json` rules as `nodum sync`/`nodum config`. Exports `IGNORED_DIRS` from `nodum-core` so watch mode can skip watching `node_modules`, `.git`, etc. at the filesystem level.

## 2.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 3395e22: Bump minimum supported Node.js version to 18 (Node 16 is end-of-life).
- b32a4c0: Sync now records a per-file manifest (`graph/files.json`) with content hash, mtime, and size for every discovered file. Pure additive plumbing — no change to existing sync behavior, output, or `graph.json` contents. Lays the groundwork for incremental sync.
